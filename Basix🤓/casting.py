########### Casting in Python ############

"pyhton data can be coverted to another data type using cating"
"lets look at the example below"


x =input("enter your number here:")
print(type(x))
print(x)
"here you see that this resturns the value asa a string but if we want to get it as a number we can simply cast that"


y =int(input("enter your number here:"))
print(type(y))
print(y)

"so you can see that the first value returns a str while second returns a int"
