Hola Everyone!
This python repository is based on the note for advanced level examination. In here there are examples and a guidance for the python. The speciality in this is that you can test the code by running it in the python shell and also YOU CAN READ THE CODE and follow through the description. No big readings just only the examples and explanations! ðŸ˜‰


Instructions:

1. Better to download this project to your pc and install a compatible version od python from python.org so you can execute the code rather than viewing it on github.(compatible mobile apps are OK ðŸ˜Œ)

2.In python File > Open> (open the file)

3. Then you can read the code and examples and you can run the code segment by segment in the shell or the whole file at once using Run > Run Module



This repository may still be in progress as the time you are viewing. Better to say that I am not an expert at all ðŸ¤¥ so if there any submit it as a pull request or let me know.

Cheers ðŸ¥‚
Lasith
